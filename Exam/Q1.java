//Question 1 : 12 Marks
//		Develop a program for a gaming store that manages in-game item purchases. The
//		program should prompt the user for the prepayment amount and the prices of two
//		different items. Subsequently, calculate the maximum quantity of each item that can be
//		bought with the prepaid amount, displaying the remaining funds in the account. Here's
//		an example:
//		Example :
//		How much money do you wish to prepay?
//		100
//		Enter the price of the first item: 20
//		Enter the price of the second item: 30
//		With this amount, you will be able to purchase 5 units of the first item and 0 units from second
//		item. You will then have $0 left as a credit on your account.
//		Alternatively, for this amount, you will be able to purchase 3 units of second item and 0 unit
//		from first item ,You will then have 10$ left as a credit on your account.
//		Thank you for shopping at Game World Store!

		//CALCULATION
//		With this amount, you will be able to purchase 5 units of the first item and 0 units from second
//		item. You will then have $0 left as a credit on your account.
//		Alternatively, for this amount, you will be able to purchase 3 units of second item and 0 unit

		//first (purchase)

		//second (alternative)
		int alternative2 = prepay/second;
		 int credit2 = prepay%second;
		int alternative1 = credit2/first;
		
		
		
		//RESULT
